        <p>   Gregory, on my word we’ll not carry coals.
            GREGORY  No, for then we should be colliers.
            SAMPSON  I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.
            GREGORY  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of
            collar.
            SAMPSON  I strike quickly, being moved.
            GREGORY  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
            SAMPSON  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
            GREGORY  To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to
            stand. Therefore if thou art moved thou runn’st
            away.
            SAMPSON  A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I
            will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
            GREGORY  That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest
            goes to the wall.</p>
