    <p>   Gregory, on my word we’ll not carry coals.
        GREGORY  No, for then we should be colliers.
        SAMPSON  I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.
        GREGORY  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of
        collar.
        SAMPSON  I strike quickly, being moved.
        GREGORY  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
        SAMPSON  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
        GREGORY  To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to
        stand. Therefore if thou art moved thou runn’st
        away.
        SAMPSON  A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I
        will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
        GREGORY  That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest
        goes to the wall.</p>
        <p>
        SAMPSON  ’Tis true, and therefore women, being the
        weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore
        I will push Montague’s men from the wall and
        thrust his maids to the wall.
        GREGORY  The quarrel is between our masters and us
        their men.
        SAMPSON  ’Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.
        When I have fought with the men, I will be civil
        with the maids; I will cut off their heads.
        GREGORY  The heads of the maids?
        SAMPSON  Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
        Take it in what sense thou wilt.
        GREGORY  They must take it in sense that feel it.
        SAMPSON  Me they shall feel while I am able to stand,
        and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
        GREGORY  ’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
        hadst been poor-john. Draw thy tool. Here comes
        of the house of Montagues.</p>
        
        <p>Enter Abram with another Servingman.
        
        SAMPSON  My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back
        thee.
        GREGORY  How? Turn thy back and run?
        SAMPSON  Fear me not.
        GREGORY  No, marry. I fear thee!
        SAMPSON  Let us take the law of our sides; let them
        begin.
        GREGORY  I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it
        as they list.
        SAMPSON  Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at
        them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.</p>
